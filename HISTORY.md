- Added topological colouring to the graphs
- Allow multiple same-edge transitions from the same vertex, in case we can't properly measuer yield points, and thus allowing probabilistic sampling (see [select_for_update](./race2_tests/postgresql/test_select_for_update.py) or [select_for_update](./race2_tests/postgresql/select_for_update.sin.gv.png))
